    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water.<br>
             Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley.<br>
             Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.<br>
        </li><br>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes.<br>
            Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.<br>
        </li><br>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li><br>
        <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce.<br>
            Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of mozzarella cheese slices.<br>
            Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.<br>
            Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.<br>
            Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.<br>
        </li><br>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
